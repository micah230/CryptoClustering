In this challenge, we use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

1. Find the Best Value for k by Using the Scaled DataFrame. 
2. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Scaled DataFrame. 
3. Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis. 
4. Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA DataFrame. 
5. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA DataFrame. 
6. Visualize and Compare the Results.
